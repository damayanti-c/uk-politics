================================================================================
INTERPRETATION NOTES
================================================================================

Red Flags for Elevated Risk:
  - Top 20 predicted probability (historical recall: 84.2%)
  - High normalized Reform alignment (>0.01)
  - High immigration focus (>10% of speeches)
  - Backbencher or long career stagnation
  - Not near retirement age

Protective Factors:
  - Current or former minister (strong protective effect)
  - Near retirement age (55-70 score > 0.5)
  - Low immigration focus (<5% of speeches)
  - Stable/moderate rhetoric over time

Model Cannot Capture:
  - Private discussions with Reform UK leadership
  - Personal scandals or controversies
  - Constituency-specific Reform UK pressure
  - Family or health considerations
  - Recent specific policy disagreements

Recommendation: Use as first-pass filter for top 20-50 MPs,
then apply qualitative analysis and local intelligence.
